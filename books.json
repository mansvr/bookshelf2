    "description": "Designing Post-Virtual Architectures: Wicked Tactics and World-Building explores, describes, and demonstrates theories and strategies for design in a post-virtual world. This book reveals affinities among social, mathematical, philosophical, and linguistic expressions integrated into a theoretical framework, facilitating design across physical and virtual space. This experience-driven framework forms the basis for data-driven, experience design methodologies. The implementation of these methodologies takes design work beyond the stylistic expressions of parameters, to data-driven, multi-modal, parametric processes of transformation.",

In order to mitigate the uncertainty associated with creative problem solving, architectural design at firms is broken into three phases, followed by a documentation phase. Feasibility or Concept Design identifies the goals of the building and a variety of ways to achieve them.",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>Presenting a novel biomimetic design method for transferring design solutions from nature to technology, this book focuses on structure-function patterns in nature and advanced modeling tools derived from TRIZ, the theory of inventive problem-solving. The book includes an extensive literature review on biomimicry as an engine of both innovation and sustainability, and discusses in detail the biomimetic design process, current biomimetic design methods and tools. The structural biomimetic design method for innovation and sustainability put forward in this text encompasses (1) the research method and rationale used to develop and validate this new design method; (2) the suggested design algorithm and tools including the Find structure database, structure-function patterns and ideality patterns; and (3) analyses of four case studies describing how to use the proposed method. This book offers an essentialresource for designers who wish to use nature as a source of inspiration and knowledge, innovators and sustainability experts, and scientists and researchers, amongst others.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Arial','sans-serif'\">Architectural Geometry is the first book to introduce a revolutionary new approach to design. Geometry lies at the core of the architectural design process. It is omnipresent, from the initial form-finding stages to the actual construction. Modern constructive geometry provides a variety of tools for the efficient design, analysis, and manufacture of complex shapes. This results in new challenges for architecture. However, the architectural application also poses new problems to geometry. Architectural geometry is therefore an entire research area, currently emerging at the border between applied geometry and architecture. Written for students, architects, construction engineers, and industrial designers – Architectural Geometry is a source of inspiration for scientists interested in applications of geometry processing in architecture and art. With over 700 pages, including 2,100 full-color images of built architecture, architectural projects, and artwork, Architectural Geometry takes readers from basic to advanced geometry then leads them to the cutting-edge of research in the architectural geometry field.</p></div>",

The book is software neutral, letting you choose the software with which to edit raster and vector graphics and to model digital objects. The clear, jargon-free introductions to key concepts and terms help you experiment and build your digital media skills. During the fabrication exercises you will learn strategies for laser cutting, CNC (computer-numerically controlled) milling, and 3D printing to help you focus on the processes of design thinking. Reading lists and essays from practitioners, instructors, and theorists ground the exercises in both broader and deeper contexts and encourage you to continue your investigative journey.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>This book provides the readers with a timely guide to the application of biomimetic principles in architecture and engineering design. As a result of a combined effort by two internationally recognized authorities, the biologist Werner Nachtigall and the architect Göran Pohl, the book describes the principles which can be used to compare nature and technology, and at the same time it presents detailed explanations and examples showing how biology can be used as a source of inspiration and “translated” in building and architectural solutions (biomimicry). Even though nature cannot be directly copied, the living world can provide architects and engineers with a wealth of analogues and inspirations for their own creative designs. But how can analysis of natural entities give rise to advanced and sustainable design? By reporting on the latest bionic design methods and using extensive artwork, the book guides readers through the field of nature-inspired architecture, offering an extraordinary resource for professional architects, engineers, designers and urban planners, as well as for university teachers, researchers and students. Natural evolution is seen throughout the book as a powerful resource that can serve architecture and design by providing innovative, optimal and sustainable solutions.</p></div>",

    "description": "<div>\n<p>We are in the second decade of the 21st century and, as with most things, the distinction between digital and analogue has become tired and inappropriate. This is also true in the world of architectural drawing, which paradoxically is enjoying a renaissance supported by the graphic dexterity of the computer. This new fecundity has produced a contemporary glut of stunning architectural drawings and representations that could rival the most recent outpouring of architectural vision in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Indeed, there is much to learn by comparing the then and the now. The contemporary drawing is often about its ability to describe the change, fluctuations and mutability of architecture in relation to the virtual/real 21st-century continuum of architectural space. Times have changed, and the status of the architectural drawing must change with them. This reassessment is well overdue, and this edition of AD will be the catalyst for such re-examination.</p></div>",
